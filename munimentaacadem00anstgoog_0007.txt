consideration of the subject, expressed their opinion in a
Treasury Minute, dated February 9, 1857, that the plan
recommended by the Master of the Rolls ‘⁶ was well
calculated for the accomplishment of this important
national object, in an effectual and satisfactory manner,
within a reasonable time, and provided proper attention
be paid to economy, in making the detailed arrange-

mcnts, without unnecessary expense.''

They expressed their approbation of the proposal that
each chronicle and historica] document should be edited

rectness the text of each writer, derived from a 6011611011

except such as were illustrative of the various readings.
They suggested, however, that the preface to each work
should contain, in addition to the particulars proposed ·
by the Master of the Rofls, a biographical account of
the author, so far as authentic materials existed for that
purpose, and. an estimate of his historical credibility and

value.
